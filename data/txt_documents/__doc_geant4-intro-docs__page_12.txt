Introduction to Geant4, Release 11.2

Categories at the bottom of the diagram are used by virtually all higher categories and provide the foundation of the
toolkit.
The
• global
category covers the system of units, constants, numerics and random number handling.
The two categories:
• materials
• particles
implement facilities necessary to describe the physical properties of particles and materials for the simulation of
particle-matter interactions.
The
• geometry
module offers the ability to describe a geometrical structure and propagate particles efficiently through it.
Above these reside categories required to describe the tracking of particles and the physical processes they undergo.
The
• track
category contains classes for tracks and steps, used by the
• processes
category, which contains implementations of models of physical interactions: electromagnetic interactions of leptons,
photons, hadrons and ions, and hadronic interactions.
All processes are invoked by the
• tracking
category, which manages their contribution to the evolution of a track’s state and provides information in sensitive
volumes for hits and digitization.
Above these the
• event
category manages events in terms of their tracks and the
• run
category manages collections of events that share a common beam and detector implementation. A
• readout
category allows the handling of pile-up.
Finally capabilities that use all of these categories and connect to facilities outside the toolkit through abstract interfaces, provide visualization, persistency and user interface capabilities.
