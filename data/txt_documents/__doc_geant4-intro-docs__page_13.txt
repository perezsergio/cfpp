GEANT4 USER SUPPORT

The collaboration offers support for Geant4, providing
• assistance with problems relating to the code,
• consultation on using the toolkit, and
• response to enhancement requests.
A user can also expect assistance in
• investigating aberrant results.
Users of the software who encounter a problem in running the code can use an
• Internet-based problem reporting system .
The system is open to all users. It is set up automatically to assign problem reports to the responsible person according
to the category affected. The contact person may then respond directly or forward it to a colleague. This system is a
customized version of the open source reporting tool Bugzilla. Besides routing the problem to specialists, it tracks and
documents the responses until the problem is resolved.
New requirements, such as requests for new functionality, are presented to and decided by the Steering Board (SB).
The SB sets the priorities and agrees on time-scales for the fulfillment of new requirements. Such support is guaranteed
to collaboration members, while requests from non-members are handled on a best effort basis.
For each member organisation a contact person (SB member) has been designated who acts as a first reference for
Geant4 users in that locality, which may include affiliated institutions, user groups, and others in the same geographic
area. The contact person will respond to enquiries, help resolve simple problems, and forward more specialized queries
to the relevant expert(s).
Beyond that, a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs), and an internet-based user forum complete the available
Geant4 user support.
